Result file:
Each line consists of a character and an integer.
A character can be one of the following:  W (Level completed), D (Ship died or Time over), L (Game over).
The integer represents the time remaining when one of the above happens.
The last line in the file will always start with a W or an L.


- Note: In save mode and simple mode, 
             the wandering ghost changes direction each time at a 50% chance -> if (rand() % 2 == 0) .

Steps file:
- The letters (a, d, w, x, s, b) are the moves of the ships.
- According to the written note, in each while loop of the game, 
   a character will be written to the step file symbolizing whether there will be a change of direction of the wandering ghost:
   '%' - There is a change of direction.
   '^' - No change.
   If the character '%' appears, immediately after it two numbers will appear (from the numbers: -1, 0, 1),
   which indicates directions to the ghost.  The first number represents x and the second number represents y.
